# Monzo Sweeper

This is a simple Go application that sweeps the balance of your account at the time of receiving a deposit above a set threshold to a designated savings pot. This is a great way of automating your monthly savings and compliments the coin jar rounding up functionality already provided by Monzo.

This is designed to be run on Heroku as I already use Heroku and this runs quite happily in the free micro dyno. It's probably not that hard to modify it for AWS Lambda or any other FaaS service provider.
